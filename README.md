Supplementary code to the paper: Label Switching in Latent Class Analysis: Accuracy of Classification, Parameter Estimates, and Confidence Intervals

- In the R file titled "1. User-defined functions," we have included the R functions that are required for the remaining two R files.

- In the R file titled "2. Parametric-bootstrap LCA," we have demonstrated the application of the parametric-bootstrap LCA through simulated data.

- In the R file titled "3. Distance-based relabeling," we have demonstrated the implementation of the distance-based relabeling algorithm for addressing label switching in a simulation study.
